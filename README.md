# FirstDjangoProject

This is a project for the module of Back-End Developing that is based on the "Writing your first Django app" project avaiable on the Django Website.
The project is for begginers in Django get familiar with the program and its tools. The application is a simple website with basic datebase where you can
find questions with choices to vote. on the first page there is a login area that tbrings you to two different portals: one for administrator where the adm 
can find tools to edit website's contents as add/edit questions and choices and also manage all the users and find them all information.
The second portal is for the normal user where they are going to find the questions to answer and the choices to choose. 
Even though the tutorial shows several steps to conclude the project, I found a bit difficult to follow correctly each one to be able to go to the next as
some informations are not as clear as it should be when we are talking about begginers doing that. And as coding, even minimun detail you lost it can crashes
the whole program. I made some changes in the datebase making the thematic of the webiste was about star signs where the questions and choices are related to
this.
